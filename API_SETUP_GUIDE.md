# RoomieRoster API Setup Guide

This comprehensive guide will walk you through setting up all the Google APIs needed for RoomieRoster deployment.

## 📋 Overview

RoomieRoster requires the following Google APIs:

### ✅ **Required APIs** (Essential for core functionality)
- **Google OAuth 2.0 / Identity API** - User authentication and access control
  - Enables secure login with Google accounts
  - Powers the roommate whitelist system
  - Required scopes: `userinfo.email`, `userinfo.profile`, `openid`

### 🔧 **Optional APIs** (Enhanced features)
- **Google Calendar API** - Calendar integration features
  - Sync chore assignments to personal calendars
  - Create calendar reminders for tasks
  - Required scopes: `calendar`, `calendar.events`

> **Note**: You can deploy RoomieRoster with just OAuth 2.0 and add Calendar API later if desired.

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- A Google account
- Access to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- The 4 roommate email addresses for your whitelist

## 📝 Step 1: Google Cloud Console Setup

2. Select any OAuth-related API and enable it

### 2.2 Enable Google Calendar API (Optional)

1. In **APIs & Services** > **Library**
2. Search for **"Google Calendar API"**
3. Click on **"Google Calendar API"**
4. Click **"Enable"**

## 🔐 Step 3: Configure OAuth Consent Screen

This is crucial for user authentication to work properly.

### 3.1 Set Up Consent Screen

1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen**
2. Choose **"External"** (unless you have a Google Workspace domain)
3. Click **"Create"**

### 3.2 Fill in App Information

**App Information:**
- **App name**: `RoomieRoster`
- **User support email**: Your email address
- **App logo**: (Optional) Upload a logo if you have one

**App domain:**
- **Application home page**: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com` (you'll get this URL from Render)
- **Application privacy policy URL**: (Optional, can skip for private app)
- **Application terms of service URL**: (Optional, can skip for private app)

**Developer contact information:**
- **Email addresses**: Your email address

### 3.3 Configure Scopes

1. Click **"Add or Remove Scopes"**
2. Filter and select these scopes:
   - `userinfo.email` - See your primary Google Account email address
   - `userinfo.profile` - See your personal info, including any personal info you've made publicly available
   - `openid` - Associate you with your personal info on Google
3. If using Calendar API, also add:
   - `calendar` - See, edit, share, and permanently delete all the calendars you can access using Google Calendar
   - `calendar.events` - View and edit events on all your calendars
4. Click **"Update"**

### 3.4 Test Users (Important for Development)

1. In the **Test users** section, click **"Add Users"**
2. Add all 4 roommate email addresses
3. Add your own email address for testing
4. Click **"Save"**

> **Important**: While in development/testing mode, only these test users can sign in!

## 🔑 Step 4: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

### 4.1 Create Credentials

1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**
2. Click **"Create Credentials"** > **"OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"**
3. Choose **"Web Application"**
4. Fill in details:
   - **Name**: `RoomieRoster Web Client`

### 4.2 Configure Authorized Redirect URIs

Add these redirect URIs (you'll need different ones for development vs production):

**For Development:**
```
http://localhost:5000/api/auth/callback
http://localhost:5001/api/auth/callback
```

**For Production (add this after deploying to Render):**
```
https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api/auth/callback
```

> **Replace `your-app-name`** with the actual app name you choose on Render.

### 4.3 Save and Download Credentials

1. Click **"Create"**
2. A popup will show your credentials - click **"Download JSON"**
3. Save this file securely - you'll need it for environment variables

The downloaded JSON will look like this:
```json
{
  "web": {
    "client_id": "your-client-id.googleusercontent.com",
    "project_id": "your-project-id",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
    "redirect_uris": ["https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api/auth/callback"]
  }
}
```

### 4.4 What to Do with Your Credentials for Render

**Important**: You just downloaded a file with your Google API credentials. Here's exactly what to do with it for Render deployment:

1. **Open the downloaded JSON file** in a text editor (like Notepad, TextEdit, or VS Code)

2. **Copy these two important values** - you'll need them for Render:
   - Find `"client_id"` - copy everything between the quotes (like `"123456789.googleusercontent.com"`)
   - Find `"client_secret"` - copy everything between the quotes (like `"GOCSPX-abcd1234...")`)

3. **Keep this file safe** but **NEVER upload it to GitHub or share it publicly**
   - Save it somewhere secure on your computer
   - You can delete it after setting up Render (the values will be stored in Render's environment variables)

4. **Write down or save these values temporarily**:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = [paste your client_id here]
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = [paste your client_secret here]
   ```

You'll enter these exact values into Render's environment variables in the next steps.

## 📦 Step 5: Setting Up Environment Variables in Render

**This is where you'll use those Google credentials you just copied!**

### 5.1 Generate a Flask Secret Key First

Before setting up Render, you need one more value - a secure secret key:

1. **Option A - Use Python (Recommended):**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt
   - Type `python3` and press Enter
   - Type this command: `import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))`
   - Copy the long random string it gives you (like `a1b2c3d4e5f6...`)
   - Type `exit()` to quit Python

2. **Option B - Use an Online Generator:**
   - Go to https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32
   - Copy the generated key

**Save this as your Flask Secret Key** - you'll need it for Render.

### 5.2 Setting Up Environment Variables in Render (Step-by-Step)

When you create your Render web service, you'll need to add these environment variables. Here's exactly how:

1. **In your Render dashboard**, after creating your web service:
   - Go to your app's page
   - Click on the **"Environment"** tab on the left sidebar

2. **Add each environment variable one by one** by clicking **"Add Environment Variable"**:

   **Variable 1:**
   - **Key**: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
   - **Value**: [Paste your client_id from the JSON file - the long string ending in `.googleusercontent.com`]

   **Variable 2:**
   - **Key**: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`  
   - **Value**: [Paste your client_secret from the JSON file - usually starts with `GOCSPX-`]

   **Variable 3:**
   - **Key**: `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`
   - **Value**: [Paste the random secret key you generated above]

   **Variable 4:**
   - **Key**: `ROOMIE_WHITELIST`
   - **Value**: [Enter your 4 roommate email addresses separated by commas, like: `john@gmail.com,jane@gmail.com,bob@gmail.com,alice@gmail.com`]

3. **Click "Save Changes"** after adding all variables

### 5.3 Important Notes for First-Time Users

**What these variables do:**
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` & `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Allow your app to talk to Google for login
- `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`: Keeps user sessions secure (like a password for your app)
- `ROOMIE_WHITELIST`: Only these email addresses can log into your app

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- ❌ Don't include quotes around the values in Render (Render handles that)
- ❌ Don't add spaces around commas in the whitelist
- ❌ Make sure email addresses in whitelist exactly match what roommates use for Google
- ✅ Use the actual Google account emails your roommates sign in with

**Example of what it should look like in Render:**
```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: 123456789012-abcdefghijklmnop.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: GOCSPX-AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz
FLASK_SECRET_KEY: a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456
ROOMIE_WHITELIST: john.doe@gmail.com,jane.smith@gmail.com,bob.wilson@gmail.com,alice.brown@gmail.com
```

## 🌍 Step 6: Production Configuration

### 6.1 Update Redirect URIs After Deployment

**IMPORTANT**: After you deploy to Render and get your actual URL, you MUST update Google:

1. **Get your Render URL first**:
   - In your Render dashboard, your app will have a URL like `https://roomieroster-abc123.onrender.com`
   - Copy this exact URL

2. **Update Google Cloud Console**:
   - Go back to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**
   - Click on your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
   - In **Authorized redirect URIs**, add:
     ```
     https://your-actual-render-url.onrender.com/api/auth/callback
     ```
     (Replace with your actual Render URL)
   - Click **"Save"**

### 6.2 Publish Your App (For Production Use)

When ready for all roommates to use (not just test users):

1. Go to **OAuth consent screen**
2. Click **"Publish App"**
3. This removes the limitation to test users only
4. Now anyone in your whitelist can log in

- 100GB bandwidth/month

**To prevent sleep (optional):**
- Upgrade to paid plan ($7/month)
- Or set up a "keep-alive" ping service

## 🧪 Step 8: Testing Your Setup

### 8.1 Test Production Deployment

After deploying to Render:

1. Visit your Render URL
2. Try logging in with a roommate email
3. Try logging in with a non-whitelisted email (should be denied)
4. Check that the app loads correctly

## 🚨 Step 9: Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

**"Application Error" on Render:**
- Check your environment variables are set correctly
- Verify your build command and start command in Render settings
- Look at the deployment logs for specific error messages
- Ensure your `requirements.txt` file is in the `backend/` directory

**"Build Failed" Error:**
- Check that your `requirements.txt` file has all necessary dependencies
- Verify Python version compatibility (use Python 3.9+ for best results)
- Look for typos in file names or paths in your configuration

**App Starts But Shows "500 Internal Server Error":**
- Usually means environment variables are missing or incorrect
- Check Render logs for detailed error messages
- Verify all required environment variables are set:
  - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
  - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`
  - `ROOMIE_WHITELIST`

**"Cannot reach this page" or Timeout:**
- Wait 3-5 minutes after deployment (first deployment takes time)
- Check if your app is sleeping on free tier (wait 30 seconds for wake-up)
- Verify your Render service is running in the dashboard

### Common Authentication Issues

**"redirect_uri_mismatch" Error:**
- Check that your redirect URI exactly matches what's configured in Google Cloud Console
- Ensure you've added the production URL after deployment
- Common mistake: forgetting `https://` prefix or `/api/auth/callback` suffix

**"access_denied" Error:**
- User might not be in the test users list (during development)
- Check if the app is published for production use
- Verify the user's email is in your `ROOMIE_WHITELIST`
- Make sure emails in whitelist exactly match what users use to sign in to Google

**"This app isn't verified" Warning:**
- Normal for unpublished apps in development
- Users can click "Advanced" > "Go to RoomieRoster (unsafe)"
- To remove this, you'd need to go through Google's verification process (not necessary for private use)

**Login Button Doesn't Work:**
- Check browser developer console for JavaScript errors
- Verify Google APIs are enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Ensure OAuth consent screen is properly configured

### Common Application Issues

**"Forbidden: Access denied" Message:**
- User's email is not in the `ROOMIE_WHITELIST` environment variable
- Check spacing and commas in the whitelist (no spaces around commas)
- Verify user is signing in with the exact email address in the whitelist

**Calendar Features Not Working:**
- Ensure Google Calendar API is enabled
- Check that calendar scopes are added to OAuth consent screen
- Verify users have granted calendar permissions

**Data Not Persisting Between Sessions:**
- On Render free tier, data resets when app sleeps
- Consider upgrading to paid plan for persistent storage
- Use external database (like PostgreSQL on Render) for production data persistence

### Checking Your Setup

1. **Verify APIs are enabled:**
   - Go to **APIs & Services** > **Enabled APIs & services**
   - Should see Google+ API (or OAuth2 API) and optionally Calendar API

2. **Verify OAuth Configuration:**
   - Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**
   - Click on your OAuth client and verify redirect URIs

3. **Check Environment Variables:**
   - In Render dashboard, verify all environment variables are set
   - Make sure `ROOMIE_WHITELIST` contains the correct email addresses

## 🔒 Step 10: Security Best Practices

1. **Keep Credentials Secure:**
   - Never commit credentials to version control
   - Use environment variables for all sensitive data
   - Regularly rotate your client secret if needed

2. **Whitelist Management:**
   - Keep your `ROOMIE_WHITELIST` up to date
   - Remove access for former roommates promptly
   - Use the actual email addresses your roommates use for Google accounts

3. **Minimal Scopes:**
   - The app only requests necessary permissions
   - Users can review what permissions they're granting

## 📞 Step 11: Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the **Google Cloud Console** > **APIs & Services** > **Quotas** for any usage limits
2. Review the **Credentials** section to ensure all redirect URIs are correct
3. Check your Render logs for any authentication errors
4. Ensure your `ROOMIE_WHITELIST` environment variable is properly formatted
