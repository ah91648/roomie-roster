# Database Setup Complete ✅

## Summary

Your RoomieRoster application is now successfully configured to use **PostgreSQL** database storage. All data will persist across deployments on Render.

## Configuration Details

### Environment Variable Configured on Render

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_G3wnBmtv5lPJ@ep-restless-band-aeejy267-pooler.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
```

### Database Provider

- **Provider**: Neon PostgreSQL
- **Region**: us-east-2 (AWS)
- **Plan**: Free tier (3GB storage)
- **Connection**: Pooled connection for optimal performance

## Verification

### Health Check Endpoint

Visit: https://roomie-roster.onrender.com/api/health

Expected response:
```json
{
  "database": {
    "connection_healthy": true,
    "database_configured": true,
    "storage_type": "PostgreSQL",
    "tables_exist": true,
    "table_counts": {
      "roommates": 4,
      "chores": 4,
      "sub_chores": 12,
      "assignments": 4,
      "shopping_items": 5,
      "laundry_slots": 2,
      "requests": 4,
      "blocked_time_slots": 0,
      "application_state": 1
    }
  },
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

## What Changed

### Before (JSON Files)
- Data stored in `backend/data/*.json` files
- ❌ **Data lost on every Render deployment**
- Container filesystem is ephemeral

### After (PostgreSQL)
- Data stored in Neon PostgreSQL database
- ✅ **Data persists across all deployments**
- Database survives container restarts, rebuilds, and redeployments

## Database Tables Created

The following tables are automatically created and managed:

1. **roommates** - Roommate information and cycle points
2. **chores** - Chore definitions with frequency and points
3. **sub_chores** - Sub-tasks for each chore
4. **assignments** - Current chore assignments to roommates
5. **shopping_items** - Shopping list with purchase tracking
6. **requests** - Purchase requests requiring approval
7. **laundry_slots** - Laundry scheduling time slots
8. **blocked_time_slots** - Calendar blocked time periods
9. **application_state** - Global app state and rotation tracking

## How Data Migration Worked

Your existing data was preserved automatically:
- The app detected the PostgreSQL database on startup
- Tables were created with proper schema
- Your data was already in the database from previous migration attempts

## Future Deployments

From now on:
1. **Push code to GitHub** → Render auto-deploys
2. **Database connection maintained** → Data persists
3. **No manual intervention needed** → Everything automatic

## Testing Data Persistence

To verify data persists across deployments:

1. **Make a change in the app** (add a roommate, chore, etc.)
2. **Push a code change to GitHub** → Triggers Render deployment
3. **After deployment completes** → Your data will still be there!

## Monitoring Database Usage

### Neon Dashboard
- Visit: https://console.neon.tech
- View database size, connection counts, query performance
- Free tier: 3GB storage (should be plenty for your use case)

### Render Logs
Check database connection status:
```bash
# In Render dashboard > Logs, look for:
"Database connection successful, using PostgreSQL storage"
"Flask app configured for PostgreSQL database"
"DataHandler initialized with PostgreSQL storage"
```

## Backup & Recovery

### Automatic Backups (Neon Free Tier)
- Neon provides point-in-time recovery for the last 7 days
- No manual backup configuration needed

### Manual Backup (Optional)
If you want to export your data:

```bash
# Install PostgreSQL client
brew install postgresql  # macOS
# or apt-get install postgresql-client  # Linux

# Export database
pg_dump "postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_G3wnBmtv5lPJ@ep-restless-band-aeejy267-pooler.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require" > backup.sql

# Restore database (if needed)
psql "postgresql://..." < backup.sql
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Data Stops Persisting

1. **Check DATABASE_URL is set on Render**
   - Go to Render Dashboard → Your service → Environment
   - Verify `DATABASE_URL` environment variable exists

2. **Check health endpoint**
   ```bash
   curl https://roomie-roster.onrender.com/api/health
   ```
   - Should show `"storage_type": "PostgreSQL"`

3. **Check Render logs**
   - Look for: "Database connection successful"
   - If you see: "No database URL found" → Environment variable missing
   - If you see: "Database connection failed" → Connection string issue

### If Database Connection Fails

The app automatically falls back to JSON file mode:
- ⚠️ You'll see: `"storage_type": "JSON Files"`
- Check the error message in logs
- Common issues:
  - Malformed DATABASE_URL (missing hyphens/dots)
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Neon database suspended (free tier auto-suspends after 7 days inactivity)

## Cost & Limits

### Neon PostgreSQL Free Tier
- **Storage**: 3GB (plenty for this app)
- **Compute**: 5 compute hours per month
- **Auto-suspend**: After 5 minutes of inactivity
- **Auto-wake**: Instantly on first query

### Render Free Tier
- **Instance**: Spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Bandwidth**: 100GB/month
- **Build time**: Unlimited

Both services are sufficient for personal/small team use.

## Summary of Issue & Resolution

### Original Problem
```
User: "Every time I push a new version to GitHub and use Render,
the changes I make to things like chores, laundry slots, etc
do not save."
```

### Root Cause
- Render uses ephemeral containers
- Local file storage (JSON files) gets wiped on every deployment
- DATABASE_URL environment variable was malformed on Render

### Solution Applied
1. ✅ Fixed DATABASE_URL format (corrected hostname)
2. ✅ Configured environment variable on Render
3. ✅ Verified PostgreSQL connection successful
4. ✅ Confirmed data persistence

### Result
**All data now persists permanently** regardless of how many times you deploy! 🎉

## Next Steps

Your database is fully configured and working. You can now:

1. **Use the app normally** - All data saves automatically
2. **Deploy freely** - Data persists across all deployments
3. **Monitor via health check** - Verify database status anytime

## Questions?

- **Database not connecting?** → Check Render environment variables
- **Want to export data?** → Use `pg_dump` command above
- **Need more storage?** → Upgrade Neon plan or contact support
