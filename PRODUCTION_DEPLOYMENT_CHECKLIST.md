    ```bash
    aws s3 ls s3://roomieroster-backups-[unique-id]/backups/
    ```

### Layer 3: Emergency Recovery System ‚úÖ

- [ ] **Verify Emergency Backups Work**
  ```bash
  cd backend
  python3 -c "
  from utils.emergency_recovery import emergency_recovery
  backup = emergency_recovery.create_emergency_backup(reason='pre_deployment')
  print(f'Backup created: {backup}')
  "
  ```

- [ ] **List Existing Backups**
  ```bash
  ls -lh backend/emergency_backups/
  # Should show .json.gz files
  ```

### Backup Verification and Testing

- [ ] **Test Disaster Recovery** (CRITICAL)
  1. Create backup:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     python3 -c "
     from utils.emergency_recovery import emergency_recovery
     emergency_recovery.create_emergency_backup(reason='test')
     "
     ```
  2. Make small test change (add test roommate in UI)
  3. Restore from backup:
     ```bash
     python3 -c "
     from utils.emergency_recovery import emergency_recovery
     emergency_recovery.restore_from_backup()
     "
     ```
  4. Verify test change is gone (confirms restore worked)

- [ ] **Document Backup Procedures**
